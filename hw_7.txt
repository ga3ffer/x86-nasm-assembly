return @ to f
f's saved ebp
20


Exercise #2

return @ to main
main's saved EBP value
z = ?		; g(1,1) is assigned to local variable
1
1
return @ to first call of g
first g's saved EBP
z = ?		; g(0,1) is assigned to local variable
1
0
return @ to second call of g
second g's saved EBP
z = ?		; before g return 1 so z is unknown


Exercise #3


main() {
    a = 2
    b = ?

    b = f(a, 4)
    print b
    print nl    
}

f(int x, int y) {
    z = 1
    if (x != 0)
      z = y + f(y, x - 1)
    return z
}
